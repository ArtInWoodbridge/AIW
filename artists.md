> I invite myself and others to slow down in order to better discern space and object. My intent is to discover the miniscule. With this discovery, the miniscule becomes monumental. The subtle becomes obvious. Questions about art and non-art become irrelevant. In many ways, the viewer’s alerted aesthetic sensibility is the art itself. The viewer’s movements within the physical space become the catalyst for how the work interacts with itself, the surroundings, and the viewer.

> History is constantly repeating itself and the more that we try to distance ourselves from the past, the more we are bound to it in the future. My work is a culmination of art historical references and an exploration of my relationship to the past.

> I sculpt because it is a perfect combination of my passions. Sculpture embraces space and form like architecture, movement and rhythm like music, and beauty and simplicity like nature. I prefer to work from intuition. I rely upon similarity of form to unite a composition. I do not know what the outcome of each piece will be until it is completed. Learning from the current work provides the inspiration for the next.

> My sculptures are products of their environment. I’m often asked what inspires me or influences my work. Frequently, it’s not until well after a piece has been completed that I understand the finer points of what motivated me. We are rarely aware of the importance of what may seem like insignificant elements. Yet when one of these elements is missing, or added, it can have dramatic effects on our lives. When I was growing up, the sculptures were an everyday part of my life. I simply don’t have the ability to verbally elaborate on their impact, so what I have done is develop a three-dimensional vocabulary that I employ in my work.

> We are all bodies in space, but where we fit into the scheme of things at large is still an open question. The cumulative effect of seeing the everyday elevated or in a new frame, it is the sense of discovering the same body in different circumstances, so it is less about the subject and more about the content.
