Sauv&#233; Art Foundation :: Building Communities through Public Art.

With an active mission of 'Building Communities Through Public Art', The Sauv&#233; Art Foundation has partnered with Live in Woodbridge.com to create a destination for public art in the City of Detroit.

The Sauv&#233; Art Foundation provides opportunities for people to give back to their community through public art projects, education programs, and events. Public Art programming enriches the lives of everyone and has a direct economic impact on the community.

Our focus is the integration of art by contemporary artists being essential elements of the built environment. Artwork provides richness and gives meaning to buildings, public places and create destinations.
